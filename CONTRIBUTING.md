# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via opening an issue,

## Our Standards

AltaML has its own dev standards that we all follow so that our repos look similar. It makes it easier for our teams 
to jump between projects without having to adapt to different workflows and coding styles. 
Those documents are in the [**home**](https://github.com/altaml/home) repo.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with new results, changes to installation guidelines, or plans and tasks completed.
3. Write a small description of what this PR does.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the PR reviewed by two other developers, or if you do not have 
permission to do that, you may request the repo owner to merge it for you.
